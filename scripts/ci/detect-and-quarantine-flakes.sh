# Detect flaky tests from a merge-group CI run and produce quarantine
# suggestions (issue #1782, root-cause detection phase §6).
#
# Input: a "flake annotations" file (passed as $1 or via $FLAKE_ANNOTATIONS)
# containing the relevant GitHub Actions log lines. The producing ci.yml step
# greps these from the job log:
#   - `::notice file=PATH::Passed on retry N (flaky)`  (in-job retry caught a flake)
#   - `::error file=PATH::...`                         (a hard failure)
#
# This script does NOT auto-append to quarantined-tests.txt. Auto-push needs a
# PAT + branch-protection bypass and is explicitly out of scope (issue #1782
# plan critic C1/C2). Instead it:
#   1. Extracts candidate test file paths from the annotations.
#   2. Applies conservative detection rules (see RULES below).
#   3. Writes surviving candidates to flake-suggestions.txt (an artifact).
#   4. Best-effort opens a tracking issue via `gh issue create` (may fail if the
#      repo's Actions token lacks issues:write — see plan critic C2). The
#      suggestions artifact is the durable fallback.
#
# Detection RULES (a candidate is DROPPED if any rule matches):
#   A. Already in any quarantine list (quarantined-tests*.txt,
#      quarantined-integration-tests.txt).
#   B. Infra-signature failure (runner starvation, runner offline, timeout with
#      no assertion) — these are transient infra, not test flakes.
#   C. Core-tree test (tests/unit/{scope,agents,hooks}/**) — these are core;
#      require human review rather than auto-suggestion.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 on macOS (no associative arrays, no grep -P). Plain
# indexed arrays + grep -E / grep -F only.

# isBotAuthored): only adopt issues authored by this workflow's own bot
# identity. Issue titles are user-controllable in a public repo; a lookalike
# issue MUST NOT absorb the bot's detection comments.

# concurrently can both find no open issue and both create — a rare duplicate
